    "**Mission Statement**: With hundreds of thousands of unique wines in existence, it can be daunting to identify what wine a user will enjoy. Wine connoisseurs want to know what type of wine they will like based on their current preferences. Our solution aims to parse wine reviews, determine important characteristics, build a model that groups wine by similarities, and offer recommendations based on user input."

If this technique is applied properly, the recommender system will be able to compare the user input wine characteristics with the ratings of previous reviewers in order to offer wine suggestions.\n",
