    "**Mission Statement**: With hundreds of thousands of unique wines in existence, it can be daunting to identify what wine a user will enjoy. Wine connoisseurs want to know what type of wine they will like based on their current preferences. Our solution aims to parse wine reviews, determine important characteristics, build a model that groups wine by similarities, and offer recommendations based on user input."

    "- **Delectable**: an app with a wine label recognition feature that allows users to find ratings, reviews, and tasting notes for a particular wine. Users can also keep a personal journal of their favorite wines.\n",

    "After exploring the dataset and implementing clustering and tree machine learning techniques, collaborative filtering will be the next step in creating the recommender system. The collaborative filtering approach suggests that if a person A has the same opinion as a person B on an issue, then the person B is more likely to have the same opinion as person A on a different issue than that of a random person. If this technique is applied properly, the recommender system will be able to compare the user input wine characteristics with the ratings of previous reviewers in order to offer wine suggestions.\n",

    "Potential complications may arise because the people writing reviews are not rating every wine, leading to a sparse users x wines matrix, which is needed for collaborative filtering. Therefore, in order to better organize the data, multiple reviews may need to be merged.\n"
